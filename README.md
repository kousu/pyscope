# pyscope

A modern software oscilloscope. Plug in leaders to an audio patch cable and watch your circuits live!

[xoscope](http://xoscope.sourceforge.net/) hasn't had a release since 2009,
so this is a remimplentation of it: shorter, in python, and more flexible. That's the end-goal, at least. It will probably languish as a hobby project, but pull requests are welcome!

Built on [SciPy](http://scipy.org) and [PySoundCard](https://github.com/bastibe/PySoundCard/) :)
