# pyscope

A modern software oscilloscope. Plug in leaders to an audio patch cable and watch your circuits live!

[xoscope](http://xoscope.sourceforge.net/) doesn't build anymore and hasn't had a release since 2006,
so this is a remimplentation of it, shorter and in python.

Built on [SciPy](http://scipy.org) and [PySoundCard](https://github.com/bastibe/PySoundCard/) :)
