# TODO

Remember that a TODO doc is a living document:
this is not a _spec_; you should edit this freely as ideas come up
and let it help you shape your ideas.

* [ ] Configurable scope window (controllable by, say, matplotlib widgets?)
* [ ] Commandline sound source option
* [ ] Reporting of underruns to the GUI
* [ ] Figure out (and write up) the intricacies of matplotlib interactive vs noninteractive mode:
  * **why is it so hard to just reliably make an empty plot and put data on it? Why does how that works change depending on environment?**
  * see: [[minimal.py]]
